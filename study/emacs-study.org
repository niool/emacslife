* emacs.d Configuration
  My emacs.d is got from https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d.
  It has a readme to learn how to use it.

* Start to use it, my version is Magit
  NOTE: Must setenv HOME explicitly, seems otherwise Commit/Push not working.
** Git Windows
   - Download git windows, use default config.
   - Config my git account
     - I already have an account in https://github.com
     - Use command:
       git config --global user.name niool
       git config --global user.email niool@hotmail.com
** Config SSH Links
   - SSH Key normally stored at ~/.ssh
   - If not, create a new one
     - ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail.com"      
     - cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
   - Config your SSH public key in github
   - Check whether config is succefully
     ssh -T git@github.com
